Crystals Collector Game:
  This is a guessing game using four gems representing number values that are reset upon page load, and are only revealed after having 
  clicked on a gem.
  The goal is to add up enough points to equal the points displayed by the computer's random pick at the start of the game... if you go 
  over, however, you loose.
